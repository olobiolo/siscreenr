# siscreenr
high throughput screening analysis package

My very own package for analyzing our siRNA based high throughput screens.
All functions were designed and written (and sometimes re-written) by myself.

------

Inspirations:

- Hadley Wickham's Advanced R (https://adv-r.hadley.nz/).

- Patrick Burns's The R inferno (https://www.burns-stat.com/pages/Tutor/R_inferno.pdf).

- Hadley Wickham's dplyr and tidyr, later incorporated into tidyverse (https://www.tidyverse.org/).

Slowly but surely transitioning away from using tidyverse in favor of data.table (https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/data.table/versions/1.12.8).

This is a work in progress. There may well be bugs I missed. All feedback is welcome.

There is extensive documentation in the form of help pages.

Long form documentation (vignettes) is pending.
