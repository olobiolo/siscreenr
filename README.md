# siscreenr
high throughput screening analysis package

My very own package for analyzing our siRNA based high throughput screens.
All functions were designed and written (and sometimes re-written) by myself.

Inspirations:
Hadley Wickham's dplyr and later tidyverse (cit).
Hadley Wickham's Advanced R (cit).
Patrick Burns's The R inferno (cit).

This repo remains private until I transfer all my local code into it. This will take a while as I am redeveloping it along the way.
The major goal is to have neat documentation that will be attached to my PhD thesis, should I ever actually write it.
