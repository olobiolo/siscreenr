\description{
Create a barplot that shows how many plates were created and imaged
over the course of the screening campaign.
}
\details{
This function will search \code{directory} for a file that matches the pattern
"screenlog". Having found the file it will read plating and imaging dates
and plot the numbers of plates corresponding to those dates.
A barplot will be created with \code{ggplot}, which can be saved to a png file.

A subdirectory called "results" will be created, if absent, to save the plot.
