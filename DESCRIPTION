Title: Analyze Genome-Wide siRNA Screening Campaigns
Version: 2.15.8
Authors@R: 
    c(person(given = "Aleksander",
             family = "Chlebowski",
             role = "aut",
             email = "olobiolo@gmail.com"),

Description: Data analysis tools for screening campaigns with a
    microscopic readout. Created to work with a genome-wide siRNA library
    and a ScanR imaging system, hence some idiosyncracies. Hopefully will
    be applicable to other setups as well.
